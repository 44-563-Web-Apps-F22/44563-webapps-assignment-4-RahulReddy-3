    <h4>THE SORCERER</h4>

    <h3 class="name">ACT II— Grounds of Sir Marmaduke's Mansion, Midnight</h3>


    <h5 class="ALEXIS">ALEXIS.</h5>           <p class="speech">I rejoice that it's decided,
        Happy now will be his life,
    For my father is provided
        With a true and tender wife.
    She will tend him, nurse him, mend him,
        Air his linen, dry his tears;
    Bless the thoughtful fate that send him
        Such a wife to soothe his years!</p>

<h5 class="ALINE">ALINE.</h5>            <p class="speech">No young giddy thoughtless maiden,
    Full of graces, airs, and jeers—
But a sober widow, laden
    With the weight of fifty years!</p>

<h5 class="SIR M">SIR M.</h5>            <p class="speech">No high-born exacting beauty
    Blazing like a jewelled sun—
But a wife who'll do her duty,
    As that duty should be done!</p>
