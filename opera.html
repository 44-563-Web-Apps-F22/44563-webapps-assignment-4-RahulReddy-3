    <h3 class="name">ACT II— Grounds of Sir Marmaduke's Mansion, Midnight</h3>


    
        <p class="actscript">Scene—Exterior of Sir Marmaduke's mansion by moonlight.  All the
          peasantry are discovered asleep on the ground, as at the end of
          Act I.</p>
      
        <p class="actscript">Enter Mr. Wells, on tiptoe, followed by Alexis and Aline. Mr. Wells
          carries a dark lantern.</p>
      
        <h4 class="ALEX">ALEX.</h4>             <p class="speech">But stay, my father is not here!</p>
      
        <h4 p class="ALINE">ALINE.</h4>            <p class="speech">And pray where is my mother dear?</p>
      
        <h4 class= "WELLS">MR. WELLS.</h4>        <p class="speech">I did not think it meet to see
                          A dame of lengthy pedigree,
                          A Baronet and K.C.B.
                          A Doctor of Divinity,
                          And that respectable Q.C.,
                          All fast asleep, al-fresco-ly,
                          And so I had them taken home
                          And put to bed respectably!
                          I trust my conduct meets your approbation.</p>
      
        <h4 class= "ALEX">ALEX.</h4>             <p class="speech">Sir, you have acted with discrimination,
          And shown more delicate appreciation
          Than we expect of persons of your station.</p>
      
        <h4 class= "WELLS">MR. WELLS.</h4>        <p class="speech">But stay—they waken one by one —
          The spell has worked—the deed is done!
          I would suggest that we retire
          While Love, the Housemaid, lights her kitchen
               fire!</p>
      
        <p class="directions">(Exeunt Mr. Wells, Alexis and Aline, on tiptoe, as the villagers
          stretch their arms, yawn, rub their eyes, and sit up.)</p>

                          <p class="song">Dear friends, take pity on my lot,
                              My cup is not of nectar!
                         I long have loved—as who would not?—
                              Our kind and reverend rector.
                         Long years ago my love began
                              So sweetly—yet so sadly—
                         But when I saw this plain old man,
                         Away my old affection ran—
                              I found I loved him madly.
                                    Oh!</p>
      
        <p class="directions">(To Notary)</p>       <p class="speech">You very, very plain old man,
          I love, I love you madly!</p>
        <h4 class="CHORUS">CHORUS.</h4>           <p class="speech">You very, very plain old man,
          She loves, she loves you madly!</p>
