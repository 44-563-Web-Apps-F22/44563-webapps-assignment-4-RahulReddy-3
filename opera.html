    <h5>ACT II— Grounds of Sir Marmaduke's Mansion, Midnight</h5>


    <pre>
        Scene—Exterior of Sir Marmaduke's mansion by moonlight.  All the
        peasantry are discovered asleep on the ground, as at the end of
        Act I.
      
        Enter Mr. Wells, on tiptoe, followed by Alexis and Aline. Mr. Wells
        carries a dark lantern.
      
                       TRIO—ALEXIS, ALINE, and MR. WELLS
      
                          'Tis twelve, I think,
                               And at this mystic hour
                          The magic drink
                               Should manifest its power.
                          Oh, slumbering forms,
                               How little ye have guessed
                          That fire that warms
                               Each apathetic breast!
      
        ALEX.             But stay, my father is not here!
      
        ALINE.            And pray where is my mother dear?
      
        MR. WELLS.        I did not think it meet to see
                          A dame of lengthy pedigree,
                          A Baronet and K.C.B.
                          A Doctor of Divinity,
                          And that respectable Q.C.,
                          All fast asleep, al-fresco-ly,
                          And so I had them taken home
                          And put to bed respectably!
                          I trust my conduct meets your approbation.
      
        ALEX.             Sir, you have acted with discrimination,
                          And shown more delicate appreciation
                          Than we expect of persons of your station.
      
        MR. WELLS.        But stay—they waken one by one —
                          The spell has worked—the deed is done!
                          I would suggest that we retire
                          While Love, the Housemaid, lights her kitchen
                               fire!
      
        (Exeunt Mr. Wells, Alexis and Aline, on tiptoe, as the villagers
        stretch their arms, yawn, rub their eyes, and sit up.)

                                           And cheeks likewise, miss!
        GIRLS. (coyly)               Oi tell you true,

                                 Country Dance
      
        (At end of dance, enter Constance in tears, leading Notary, who
        carries an ear-trumpet)
      
                                Aria—CONSTANCE
      
                          Dear friends, take pity on my lot,
                               My cup is not of nectar!
                          I long have loved—as who would not?—
                               Our kind and reverend rector.
                          Long years ago my love began
                               So sweetly—yet so sadly—
                          But when I saw this plain old man,
                          Away my old affection ran—
                               I found I loved him madly.
                                     Oh!
      
        (To Notary)       You very, very plain old man,
                               I love, I love you madly!
        CHORUS.           You very, very plain old man,
                               She loves, she loves you madly!
        NOTARY.           I am a very deaf old man,
                               And hear you very badly!
      
        CONST.            I know not why I love him so;
                               It is enchantment, surely!
                          He's dry and snuffy, deaf and slow
                               Ill-tempered, weak and poorly!
                          He's ugly, and absurdly dressed,
                               And sixty-seven nearly,
                          He's everything that I detest,
                          But if the truth must be confessed,
                               I love him very dearly!
                                     Oh!
      
        (To Notary)       You're everything that I detest,
                               But still I love you dearly!
      
        CHORUS.           You've everything that girls detest,
                               But still she loves you dearly!
      
        NOTARY.           I caught that line, but for the rest,
                               I did not hear it clearly!
      
        (During this verse Aline and Alexis have entered at back
        unobserved.)
