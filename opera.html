    <h5>ACT II— Grounds of Sir Marmaduke's Mansion, Midnight</h5>


    
        <p>Scene—Exterior of Sir Marmaduke's mansion by moonlight.  All the
          peasantry are discovered asleep on the ground, as at the end of
          Act I.</p>
      
        <p>Enter Mr. Wells, on tiptoe, followed by Alexis and Aline. Mr. Wells
          carries a dark lantern.</p>
      
                       <h6>TRIO—ALEXIS, ALINE, and MR. WELLS</h6>
      
                          <p>'Tis twelve, I think,
                              And at this mystic hour
                         The magic drink
                              Should manifest its power.
                         Oh, slumbering forms,
                              How little ye have guessed
                         That fire that warms
                              Each apathetic breast!</p>
      
        <h6>ALEX.</h6>             <p>But stay, my father is not here!</p>
      
        <h6>ALINE.</h6>            <p>And pray where is my mother dear?</p>
      
        <h6>MR. WELLS.</h6>        <p>I did not think it meet to see
                          A dame of lengthy pedigree,
                          A Baronet and K.C.B.
                          A Doctor of Divinity,
                          And that respectable Q.C.,
                          All fast asleep, al-fresco-ly,
                          And so I had them taken home
                          And put to bed respectably!
                          I trust my conduct meets your approbation.</p>
      
        <h6>ALEX.</h6>             <p>Sir, you have acted with discrimination,
          And shown more delicate appreciation
          Than we expect of persons of your station.</p>
      
        <p>MR. WELLS.</p>        <p>But stay—they waken one by one —
          The spell has worked—the deed is done!
          I would suggest that we retire
          While Love, the Housemaid, lights her kitchen
               fire!</p>
      
        <p>(Exeunt Mr. Wells, Alexis and Aline, on tiptoe, as the villagers
          stretch their arms, yawn, rub their eyes, and sit up.)</p>
      
        <h6>MEN.</h6>        <p>Why, where be oi, and what be oi a doin',
          A sleepin' out, just when the dews du rise?</p>

                                   <h6>Country Dance</h6>
      
        <p>(At end of dance, enter Constance in tears, leading Notary, who
          carries an ear-trumpet)</p>
      
                                <h6>Aria—CONSTANCE</h6>
      
                          <p>Dear friends, take pity on my lot,
                              My cup is not of nectar!
                         I long have loved—as who would not?—
                              Our kind and reverend rector.
                         Long years ago my love began
                              So sweetly—yet so sadly—
                         But when I saw this plain old man,
                         Away my old affection ran—
                              I found I loved him madly.
                                    Oh!</p>
      
        <p>(To Notary)</p>       <p>You very, very plain old man,
          I love, I love you madly!</p>
        <h6>CHORUS.</h6>           <p>You very, very plain old man,
          She loves, she loves you madly!</p>
        <h6>NOTARY.</h6>           <p>I am a very deaf old man,
          And hear you very badly!</p>
      
        <h6>CONST.</h6>            <p>I know not why I love him so;
          It is enchantment, surely!
     He's dry and snuffy, deaf and slow
          Ill-tempered, weak and poorly!
     He's ugly, and absurdly dressed,
          And sixty-seven nearly,
     He's everything that I detest,
     But if the truth must be confessed,
          I love him very dearly!
                Oh!</p>
      
        <p>(To Notary)</p>       <p>You're everything that I detest,
          But still I love you dearly!</p>
      
        <h6>CHORUS.</h6>           <p>You've everything that girls detest,
          But still she loves you dearly!</p>
      
        <h6>NOTARY.</h6>           <p>I caught that line, but for the rest,
          I did not hear it clearly!</p>
      
        <p>(During this verse Aline and Alexis have entered at back
          unobserved.)</p>
